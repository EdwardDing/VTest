Vocabulary Test on OSX

A simple self use vocabulary test on OSX. Word list is stored using SQLITE database.

Now this is only an alpha version simply included basic test functions and TOEFL vocabulary. More functions will be added soon.

If you are interested in this project, please join me! I need someone who is good at sqlite as well as cocoa development.
