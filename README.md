Vocabulary Test on OSX

A simple self use vocabulary test on OSX. Word list is stored using SQLITE database.

Now this is only an alpha version simply included basic test functions and TOEFL vocabulary. More functions will be added soon.

A highlight in this project is that we use the `speechSythesizer` class to read the word, which can save us a lot of space as we don't need to put the huge voice files in the APP. Also, you can download and choose different speaker voice from your mac.

Actually I can't finish this project on my own, so if you are interested in this project, please join me! I need someone who is good at sqlite as well as cocoa development.
